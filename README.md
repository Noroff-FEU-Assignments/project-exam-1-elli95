## Project Exam 1

This is the Project Exam 1 (spring 2023) by Elise Marie Hogsnes, from the August 2022 frontend development class, Noroff. This project shows my blog The Cozy Cooking Pot.

# Description

This project is a food blog that contains a main page, a blog list page, a specific blog page, an about us page and a contact page.
It contains several different blog posts, where you can sort, search and look through the different posts.
It is also possible to add comments to the various blog posts, and you can read more about the fictitious owner.
You can also use a contact form, but you probably won't get many answers anytime soon.
